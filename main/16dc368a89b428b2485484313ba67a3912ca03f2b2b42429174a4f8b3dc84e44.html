<p>Last night, I had a meal that left Up a lasting impression, but not in a good way.<br>
    The Top layer of the steak was over-seasoned, while the Bottom was undercooked and tough.<br>
    It was a Strange combination of flavors and textures that didn't quite Charm my palate.<br>
    As I struggled to finish the dish, I couldn't help but feel let Down by the restaurant's reputation.<br>
    However, as I looked around, I noticed the staff working tirelessly to ensure each patron was well taken care of.<br>
    Their dedication and attention to detail from top to bottom was truly admirable, and it reminded me that a restaurant's true charm lies not just in its food, but in its service as well.<br>
    How many am I?<br>
    Answer type: Number</p><br />
